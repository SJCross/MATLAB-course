MATLAB for image processing course
==================================

Materials for the "MATLAB for image processing" course taught at the Wolfson Bioimaging Facility, University of Bristol.

This workshop is suitable for anyone acquiring microscopy data as part of their research. No prior knowledge of MATLAB or programming is necessary or assumed. The practical components are designed to enable attendees to work at their own pace.

The course is formed of four 2 hour sessions, each introducing new concepts relevant in particular to image processing and analysis.  Each session contains a PowerPoint presentation of new concepts and a text worksheet to practice these.

Note: The following is a draft course layout and may change as the materials are produced.
