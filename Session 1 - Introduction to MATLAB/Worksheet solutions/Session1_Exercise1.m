% Session 1, Exercise 1: Creating a new script
%
% All this script needs to contain at the moment is a single line to print
% some text to the command window when run.  This lets us know we're able
% to run the script.

% The first line of our script should be clear, which removes anything from
% previous runs from the workspace
clear

% Displaying the text
disp('Hello from an M-file!')
